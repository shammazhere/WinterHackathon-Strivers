# 🎉 Material Theme Icons is now part of [Vira Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vira.vsc-vira-theme) [<img src="https://vira-themes.github.io/vira-theme-support/assets/vira-logo.png" alt="Material Theme" width="90" height="90" align="right">](https://vira.build)

<h5>⚠️ Material Theme Icons has officially reached the end of its journey — no more updates, no new features. You might come across a bunch of clones out there, but none of them are made by the original creator, and they’re not being maintained. They’re missing the love, care, and passion that went into the original Material Theme, and now into Vira Theme.</h5>
